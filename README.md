Light polarizer simulation to display light travelling as a wave through a polarizer, resulting in linearly polarized light. The incident light is linearly polarized by default, which is created by calculating the sine of the phase angle. Circularly polarized light uses the sine and cosine of the phase angle. Unpolarized light uses the sine and cosine of the phase angle, but applies a random phase and frequency each timestep.
