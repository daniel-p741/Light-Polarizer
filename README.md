Light polarizer simulation to display light traveling as a wave through a polarizer, resulting in linearly polarized light. The incident light is linearly polarized by default, which is created by calculating the sine of the phase angle. Circularly polarized light uses the sine and cosine of the phase angle. Unpolarized light uses the sine and cosine of the phase angle, but with a random phase and frequency applied each timestep. Following Malus's Law, the intensity of the resulting light changes based on the angle of the polarizer.
